# Jupyter notebooks
These Jupyter notebooks were created & used during original development of the
code and associated paper: [Arthur P. Guillaumin, Laure Zanna (2021).
Stochastic-deep learning parameterization of ocean momentum
forcing][gz21-paper-agupubs]. The exact version of the code used to produce said
paper can be found on [Zenodo][gz21-paper-code-zenodo]. 

## 2021 paper figures
The `generate-paper-figure-X.ipynb` notebooks were used to generate the stated
number figure in the 2021 paper.

The data for `generate-paper-figure-1.ipynb` can be generated by running

```
mlflow run . --experiment-name <name>--env-manager=local \
-P lat_min=-80 -P lat_max=80 -P long_min=-280 -P long_max=80 \
-P factor=4 \
-P CO2=1 -P global=0 \
-P ntimes=3000 \
-P chunk_size=1
```
. The notebook generates figure 1b. 

For `generate-paper-figure-6.ipynb`, which generates figure 6b, the same call has to be run with again with `CO2=1`. The notebook is then asking for the data set with `CO2=0` first and the one with `CO2=1` second.

`test-global-control.ipynb` generates figures 4, 5 and 7. For this, the inference step with the trained neural network has to be run both on the data with `CO2=1` and `CO2=1`.
