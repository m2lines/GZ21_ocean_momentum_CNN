# Jupyter notebooks for generating figures used in Guillaumin (2021)
Ensure to read the readme in the folder above this one first.

## Figure 1
`generate-paper-figure-1.ipynb` generates figure 1b. The forcings it uses can be
generated by running the data step with the following configuration:

```
python src/gz21_ocean_momentum/cli/data.py \
--config-file resources/cli-configs/data-paper.yaml \
--ntimes 4000
```

## Figure 6
`generate-paper-figure-6.ipynb`, which generates figure 6b, requires the above
forcing data, plus another set of forcings generated using the 1% annual CO2
increase CM2.6 dataset. Use the same command as above, with `--co2-increase`.

## Figures 4, 5, 7
`test-global-fig-4-5-7.ipynb` generates figures 4, 5 and 7, as well as D4 and
D5. For this, the inference step with the trained neural network has to be run
both on the data with and without `--co2-increase`, and then the notebook needs
to be run once with each set. *(The neural net may be trained only once, on data
without `--co2-increase`.)* The paper figures referring to _piControl_ are those
without `--co2-increase` (the control simulation with pre-industrial CO2
levels), and the figures referring to _1pctCO2_ are those with `--co2-increase`
(a 1% increase per year in CO2 levels for the first 70 years, after which they
remain constant).
