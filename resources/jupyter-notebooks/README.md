These Jupyter notebooks were created & used during original development of the
code and associated paper: [Arthur P. Guillaumin, Laure Zanna (2021).
Stochastic-deep learning parameterization of ocean momentum
forcing][gz21-paper-agupubs]. The exact version of the code used to produce said
paper can be found on [Zenodo][gz21-paper-code-zenodo].

## Usage
Follow the installation instructions in the main project readme.

Run `jupyter notebook` from project/repository root.

You will also need to install Jupyter Notebook: `pip install notebook`

Individual notebooks may have further dependencies. These should be displayed at
the top of the notebook. The following packages are particularly common (`pip
install <pkg>`):

  * `ipympl`
  * `cmocean`

## 2021 paper figures
There are several notebooks which were used to generate the figures in the 2021
paper. These are stored in [`paper/`](paper/). See the readme in that folder for
further details.

## Other notebooks
The other notebooks stored here may need updating in order to run.
